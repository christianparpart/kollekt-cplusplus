- make use of splice() syscall for maximum performance
- instead of strlen inside the calees do pass the precomputed len by the caller
- rewrite Writer code to run in a seperate (select()/poll()-based or non-polling) thread,
  because epoll() does not seem to support local file system events :(
- write *proper* CSV header
- wrote a C-based producer for performance testing
- hook into system signal (USR1) to log bucket stats
- graceful exit via SIGTERM and SIGINT (C-c)
